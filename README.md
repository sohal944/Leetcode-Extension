# LeetCode Problem Scraper

This project is an Electron-based application that scrapes problem statements and test cases from LeetCode. Users can input a LeetCode problem URL, fetch the problem data (title and test cases), and run solutions in Python and C++.

## Features:
- Fetch LeetCode problem data (title, problem statement, and test cases) using puppeteer.
- Save the scraped test_cases in json form in backend.
- Run the user given code and compare the expected output and actual output.
- Display the problem statement and test cases on the frontend. //Still in work
